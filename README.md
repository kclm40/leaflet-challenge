## Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

   * Used Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from my dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

       *  Data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appeared larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appeared darker in color.

   * Included popups that provided additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that provided context for my map data.

* Plotted the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.

* Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Added layer controls to the map.
